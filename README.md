# MWE-URLfilessummarised
A simple working example of consolidating multiple CSVs and producing summary stats from them.

Therer are two sample CSVs with data in. These get read in by scriptMWE.R which then calculates some summaries and writes these to disk.

It is a not a robust example - for instance you can consume CSVs with different column names etc. but this is intended to show potential workflow.
